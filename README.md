Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `Component`

In App component we define a search box and two buttons for showing the weather for a day or a week and we also render a Home component for showing the weather of a particular day. After clicking on the week button we can show the data for 5 day faorecast weather.
